/**
 * A {@code Processor} is a highly-efficient data processor that is backed by an <a
 * href="https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor">LMAX Disruptor RingBuffer</a>.
 * <p/>
 * Rather than dealing with dynamic {@link Consumer} registration and event routing, the {@code Processor} gains its
 * extreme efficiency from pre-allocating the data objects (for which you pass a {@link Supplier} whose job is to
 * provide new instances of the data class on startup) and by baking-in a {@code Consumer} for published events.
 * <p/>
 * The {@code Processor} can be used in two different modes: single-operation or batch. For single operations, use the
 * {@link #prepare()} method to allocate an object from the {@link RingBuffer}. An {@link Operation} is also a {@link
 * Supplier}, so call {@link reactor.function.Supplier#get()} to get access to the data object. One can then update the
 * members on the data object and, by calling {@link reactor.core.processor.Operation#commit()}, publish the event into
 * the {@link RingBuffer} to be handled by the {@link Consumer}.
 * <p/>
 * To operate on the {@code Processor} in batch mode, first set a {@link BatchConsumer} as the {@link Consumer} of
 * events. This interface provides two additional methods, {@link reactor.function.batch.BatchConsumer#start()}, which
 * is invoked before the batch starts, and {@link reactor.function.batch.BatchConsumer#end()}, which is invoked when the
 * batch is submitted. The {@link BatchConsumer} will work for either single-operation mode or batch mode, but only a
 * {@link BatchConsumer} will be able to recognize the start and end of a batch.
