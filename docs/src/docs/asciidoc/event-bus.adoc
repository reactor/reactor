[[bus-publish-subscribe]]
== Publish/Subscribe
Using an `EventBus` to publish and respond to events using Publish/Subscribe.

Reactor's `EventBus` allows you to register a `Consumer` to handle events when the notification key matches a certain condition. This assignment is achieved via the `Selector`. It's similar to subscribing to a topic, though Reactor's `Selector` implementations can match on a variety of criteria, from `Class<?>` type to regexes, to `JsonPath` expressions. It is a very flexible and powerful abstraction that provides a wide range of possibilities.

You can register multiple Consumers using the same `Selector` and multiple `Selectors` can match a given key. This way it's easy to do aggregation and broadcasting: you simply subscribe multiple `Consumers` to the same topic `Selector`.

[NOTE]
====
If you're upgrading from Reactor 1.1, you'll see that the `Reactor` class no longer exists. It has been renamed to `EventBus` to more accurately reflect its role in the framework.

.Handling events using a Selector
[source,java]
----
EventBus bus = EventBus.create(Environment.get()); // <1>

bus.on($("topic"), (Event<String> ev) -> {
  String s = ev.getData();
  System.out.printf("Got %s on thread %s%n", s, Thread.currentThread());
}); // <2>

bus.notify("topic", Event.wrap("Hello World!")); // <3>
----
<1> Create an `EventBus` using the default, shared `RingBufferDispatcher` from the static `Environment`.
<2> Assign a `Consumer` to invoke when the `EventBus` is notified with a key that matches the `Selector`.
<3> Publish an `Event` into the `EventBus` using the given topic.

[NOTE]
====
The shorthand static method `$` is just a convenience helper that is identical to `Selectors.object()`. Some people don't like to use the shorthand methods like `$()` for `ObjectSelector`, `R()` for `RegexSelector`, `T()` for `ClassSelector`, and so forth. The link:/docs/api/reactor/bus/selector/Selectors.html#method.summary[Selectors] class has longer method name alternatives for these shorthand versions, which are simply aliases to reduce code noise and make reactive code a little more readable.

[[bus-request-reply]]
== Request/Reply
Using an `EventBus` to publish and respond to events using Request/Reply.

It's often the case that you want to receive a reply from a task executed on an EventBus's configured `Dispatcher`. Reactor's `EventBus` provides for more event handling models beyond the simple publish/subscribe model. You can also register a `Function` rather than a `Consumer` and have the `EventBus` automatically notify a `replyTo` key of the return value of the `Function`. Rather than using the `.on()` and `.notify()` methods, you use the `.receive()`, and `.send()` methods.

.Request/Reply
[source,java]
----
EventBus bus;

bus.on($("reply.sink"), ev -> {
  System.out.printf("Got %s on thread %s%n", ev, Thread.currentThread())
}); // <1>

bus.receive($("job.sink"), ev -> {
  return doWork(ev);
}); // <2>

bus.send("job.sink", Event.wrap("Hello World!", "reply.sink")); // <3>
----
<1> Assign a `Consumer` to handle all replies indiscriminantly.
<2> Assign a `Function` to perform work in the `Dispatcher` thread and return a result.
<3> Publish an `Event` into the bus using the given `replyTo` key.

If you don't have a generic topic on which to publish replies, you can combine the request and reply operation into a single call using the `.sendAndReceive(Object, Event<?>, Consumer<Event<?>>)` method. This performs a `.send()` call and invokes the given replyTo callback on the `Dispatcher` thread when the Functions are invoked.

.sendAndReceive()
[source,java]
----
EventBus bus;

bus.receive($("job.sink"), (Event<String> ev) -> {
  return ev.getData().toUpperCase();
}); // <1>

bus.sendAndReceive(
    "job.sink",
   Event.wrap("Hello World!"),
   s -> System.out.printf("Got %s on thread %s%n", s, Thread.currentThread())
); // <2>
----
<1> Assign a `Function` to perform work in the `Dispatcher` thread and return a result.
<2> Publish an `Event` into the bus and schedule the given replyTo `Consumer` on the `Dispatcher`, passing the receive Function's result as input.

=== Cancelling a Task

Sometimes you want to cancel a task to cause it to stop responding to event notifications. The registration methods `.on()` and `.receive()` return a `Registration` object which, if a reference to it is held, can be used later to cancel a `Consumer` or `Function` for a given `Selector`.

[source,java]
----
EventBus bus;

Registration reg = bus.on($("topic"),
                          s -> System.out.printf("Got %s on thread %s%n", s, Thread.currentThread()));

bus.notify("topic", Event.wrap("Hello World!")); // <1>

// ...some time later...
reg.cancel(); // <2>

// ...some time later...
bus.notify("topic", Event.wrap("Hello World!")); // <3>
----
<1> Publish an event to the given topic. Should print `Event.toString()` in the console.
<2> Cancel the `Registration` to prevent further events from reaching the `Consumer`.
<3> Nothing should happen as a result of this notification.

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that canceling a `Registration` involves accessing the internal `Registry` in an atomic way. In a system in which a large number of events are flowing into Consumers, it's likely that your `Consumer` or `Function` might see some values after you've invoked the `.cancel()` method, but before the `Registry` has had a chance to clear the caches and remove the `Registration`. The `.cancel()` method could be described as a "request to cancel as soon as possible".

You'll notice this behavior right away in test classes where there's no time delay between the `.on()`, `.notify()`, and `.cancel()` invocations.
