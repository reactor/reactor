== Reactor on Clojure with Meltdown.

[quote, README, project page]
Meltdown is a Clojure interface to Reactor, an asynchronous programming, event passing and stream processing toolkit for the JVM.
It follows the path of Romulan, an old ClojureWerkz project on top of LMAX Disruptor that's been abandoned.
